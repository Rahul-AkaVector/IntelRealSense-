# Intel RealSense Project

## Overview

Intel RealSense is a Python-based project designed for detecting body angles and mimicking movements to robots. It utilizes AI and computer vision techniques to track hand posture, calculate elbow angles, and generate movement commands.

## Features

- Real-time body angle detection
- Hand posture tracking
- AI-powered movement analysis
- Robot motion integration

## Usage

ðŸ”´ **Note:** This project requires an Intel RealSense camera to function properly. It has been tested on the Intel RealSense D435 camera, but compatibility with other models may vary. Please check your camera configuration before use.
